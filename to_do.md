Things to be Done
-----------------

- Link appropriate .dotfiles to github repo, push

- Backup everything important using `rsync`

- Track down startup processes that might be left over from virtualbox tools.
  (look in sudo startup processes too)

- Fix issue causing lack of sleep at times

- *After backing up,* pacman -Syu

- Maybe switch things over to tmux

- Go through Vim plugins and refresh ~/.vimrc

- Make cool Conky background


- Revamp website to be more like this: https://csswizardry.com/about/#colophon
    - make sure it's project focused... showcases stuff... fuck html, MD BABY!

- put up jekyll site in systems programming course for class notes


- modify embedded firmware reflash to swap caps lock and ctrl keys, and at
  least do so in software

- also use some program called xscape to make caps on it's own act as esacpe

- use super+enter for opening single terminal, and super + t for opening a
  large terminal with tmux running divided into four different screens

- when the time comes, replace keyboard with that of a t420, and replace the
  palm rest + add stickers to machine

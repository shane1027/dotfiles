- add script that hard links all files appropriately in the OS w/ those here

- include copying / hard linking appropriate vim-airliner and zsh themes

- write service to automatically detect changes every ~hour in this repo, and
  commit them with a time and date stamp... only alert user if issue on merge.

- also auto-sync w/ upstream in that service^^
